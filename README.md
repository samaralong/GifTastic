# GifTastic

Homework assignment focusing primarily on APIs and AJAX.

In this assignment, we were asked to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs on a topic of our choice.

Requirements include: calling on the GIPHY API and using Javascript/jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

# Summary

I chose movies as my topic. The webpage will automatically load a number of pre-made buttons of some of my favorite movies. When a button is clicked, 10 of the most relevant gifs will populate below. The gifs can be animated by clicking on the image.

If you don't see a movie you like, you can input your own on the panel on the right!
